This plugin provides an easy way to view *.log files directly in the admin panel.

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy way to view *.log files directly in admin panel of your wordpress. Also you can perform simple actions like empty the file or deleting it. The plugin is recommended to use only in development.

To activate Wordpress logging to file you have to set `define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );` in your wp-config.php file.

**Known limitations:**

* Autorefresh is currently fixed at 15 seconds if enabled - will let you choose custom timing soon
* Options not realy well placed - have to have a look at solutions of other plugins
* Take care in MU installations. As the plugin lists all *.log files in WP_CONTENT_DIR it doesn't separate blogs ... yet!

**ToDo as of 013.05.19:**

* handling files in MU installations
* catching some not set requirements
* adding in-code documentation
* Translations ( DE )

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to enable debug.log =
Simply add `define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );` in your wp-config.php file.

= I changed my error_log to something other than WP default =
That's ok ... as long as the file extension is .log and it's located in WP_CONTENT_DIR. Other sources or extensions aren't supported for now.

= Can i show other files? =
Yes you can! This plugin automatically looks for log files located in WP_CONTENT_DIR and have a .log extension.
Other sources can be added Other sources or extensions aren't supported for now.

= In Files View i only get the error message "Could not load file." or "No files found." =
It looks like there isn't a *.log file in WP_CONTENT_DIR. Wich could mean there are no errors. Yay!
If there are files, it could be that they are not readable ( check your permissions ) or it's a bug ... Booo!

= I don't see File Actions options =
The options are only displayed if the file is writeable. Check your permissions.
